> [!CAUTION]
> IT IS CRUCIAL TO ACTIVATE CONTROLLERS ONLY WHEN THEIR REQUIRED INTERFACES ARE AVAILABLE AND UNCLAIMED
> ALSO DO NOT DEACTIVATE HARDWARE COMPONENT WITH INTERFACES WHICH ARE USED BY CONTROLLERS

# Important commands

## Listing
```ros2 control list_controllers``` - shows which controllers are active/inactve 

```ros2 control list_hardware_interfaces``` - shows which interfaces are available and claimed 

```ros2 control list_hardware_components``` - shows hardware components, their current status and their hardware interfaces 


## Activating/deactivating
```ros2 control switch_controllers [--deactivate [CTRL1 [CTRL2 ...]]] [--activate [CTRL1 [CTRL2 ...]]]``` - deactivate/activate certain controllers 

```ros2 control set_controller_state controller_name {inactive,active}``` - set state of one controller 

```ros2 control set_hardware_component_state hardware_component_name {unconfigured,inactive,active}``` - set state of one hardware component 

## Examples

### 1. You want to activate ```controller_A``` which requires interfaces from ```hardware_component_B``` which is inactive:
```
ros2 control set_hardware_component_state hardware_component_B active
ros2 control set_controller_state controller_A active
```

Controller and hardware component respectively will change their states from inactive to active while calling function onActivate()


### 2. You want to deactivate a ```hardware_component_A``` which  interfaces are claimed by ```controller_B```:
```
ros2 control set_controller_state controller_B inactive
ros2 control set_hardware_component_state_A inactive
```

Controller and hardware component respectively will change their states from active to inactive while calling function onDeactivate()
